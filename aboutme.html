                <p>
                    <b>Agent Moore</b> - started off as a college freshman that had an innate interest in the technology field. Often called by his family members to "fix their devices", <i>(usually involves changing the batteries but don't tell them that...),</i> decided to work at BestBuy as a computer sales consultant.
                </p> 
                <p>
                   After two years of creating lasting connections with clients, Tariq Moore felt it his calling to take up the mantle and become an Agent of <b>Geek Squad</b>.

                    <b>"Where is he now?"</b>, you ask? Will he still answer the call to replace the remote batteries to fix the TV?
                </p>

                <p>Okay I'll stop with the comic book origin story!
                    <br>
                    I work at Geek Squad as both a Consultation Agent and Advanced Repair Agent with the goal to help make technology easier to understand for the world.
                </p>
                <p>My aspirations are to be a Frontend Developer/Game Developer. I've achieved a great understanding concepts in multiple different programming languages with two years of experience in: <br>
                Java, Python, and my favorite <em>The Frontend Trifecta</em> - HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
                </p>

                <section id="music">
                    <p>I'm very passionate about not only frontend development but also music. My room is honestly filled with instruments including piano, ukuleles, saxophones, acoustic guitars, and my latest acquisition, bass guitar.
                    </p> 
                    <p>The world without music is like missing that cup of morning coffee. For me the ability to <b>create</b> something from a blank canvas is a very interesting thing.</p>

                    <p>I find music production and frontend development to be parallels in that aspect.</p>
